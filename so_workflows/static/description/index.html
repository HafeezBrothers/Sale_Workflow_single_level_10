                1. When there are multiple users working in their respective scopes then it gets very important that no user invades the other users scope of work or authority. That's why workflows are designed for different forms.

    		<p style="margin-left:40px;">
    		    2. In ODOO, only a manager can validate a document. But the issues is that the manager also gets access to configuration. So workflows are very useful when you want to assign approving authority to a specific person and at the same time you don't want him/ her to access the configuration panel.
